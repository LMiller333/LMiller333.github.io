            <h2>Hello world!</h2>
            <p class="lead">As I read those two little words on my computer screen, I knew that I had made a huge mistake.</p>
            <p>If you’ve ever taken a beginning programming class, chances are that the first command you wrote made the words “Hello world!” appear. Seeing that message appear before me, based on a tiny string of code I had written, just seemed too good to be true. Of course, I did what anyone would do...</p>
            <p>I revised the program to insult people that I loved! So this was my first original program — it asked you to enter your name, and if your name was James (my boyfriend’s name), it told you that you were lazy and should make your girlfriend some nachos.</p>
            <p>I was thrilled. Not just because I had found another way to ask my boyfriend (and other people named James) for nachos, but because I understood for the first time the beauty and power of programming. In that moment, I saw the potential for logic and algorithms to allow me to do more and do better.</p>
            <p>That was also when I realized my mistake: I should have studied computer science.</p>   
            <p>Thankfully, I discovered user experience. </p>
